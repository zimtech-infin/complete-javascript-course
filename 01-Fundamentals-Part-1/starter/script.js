//Objects and primitives in javascript: 


/*

Primitive data types: Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, BigInt
Number: let age = 25;
String: let name = "John";
Boolean: let isStudent = true;
Undefined: let address;
Null: let car = null;
Symbol: let id = Symbol("unique");
BigInt: let bigNumber = 9007199254740991n;

These examples demonstrate the basic usage of each data type. It's important to note that JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold different types of values at different times.
